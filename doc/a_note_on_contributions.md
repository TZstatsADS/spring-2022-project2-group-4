### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Sample project README statement.

Project: Outing Avenues in NYC in times of Covid-19

Team members: Chen Gexin, Khan Zaigham, Ma Xiangyu, Naik Vaishak, Vedula Varchasvi

Summary: In this project, we developed an app targeted at the residents of NYC who are looking for outing avenues. Through this app, we aim to suggest the places to visit in NYC by keeping in consideration the Covid outbreak.

[Contribution Statement]  All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. First each of us went through the NYC data and then we collected to brainstorm the best data source to use for this project. Finally, we decided to create an app which could merge the outing options of residents in NYC to the number of covid cases in the area. The roles were definined based on the functionality of the project. Chen, Gexin and Ma, XiangYu collaborated to work on 'Park Reopen Situation' tab. They used the data of athletic facilities, playgrounds, adult exercise equipments, dog runs, comfort stations, skate parks and events to show a comparison of open avenues in NYC during present times as well as the situation at the peak of COVID-19. Vedula, Varchavi worked on the 'Restaurants and Covid Risk' tab. He used the restaurant data set to show the dining options in NYC, but also used the COVID-19 data to highlight the areas with a high covid positivity rate, so that people can take informed decision. Naik, Vaishak worked on the 'Symptoms Frequency Map' and used the emergency hospital registration data to higlight the areas in NYC with a high number of pnemonia cases. He has also used the symptoms data to show a trend of covid cases in different counties. He was also responsible for smooth working of Git across all the members. Khan, Zaigham worked on the overall look, feel and functionality of the app. He created the map icons to represent different status of outing avenues. He was responsible for creating a final deliverable.
